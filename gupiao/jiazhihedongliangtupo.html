Revenue guidance was below estimates, solely due to currency fluctuations assumptions.

North America increased 12% to $86.3 billion. International segment sales increased 10% year-over-year to $31.9 billion. Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment sales increased 17% year-over-year to $25 billion.</p> <p>Profit margins are expanding vigorously due to scale efficiencies in retail and logistics, contributions from advertising, and the positive margin impact of AWS.

First, companies have largely completed the lion's share of their cost optimization and turned their attention to newer initiatives. Before the pandemic, companies were marching to modernize their infrastructure, moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud to save money, innovated at a more rapid rate, and to drive more developer productivity. The pandemic and uncertain economy that followed distracted from that momentum, but it's picking up again. Companies are pursuing this relatively low-hanging fruit in modernizing their infrastructure.</p> <p>And with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, deepest partner ecosystem and strong security and operational performance, AWS continues to be their strong partner of choice. Our AWS customers are also quite excited about leveraging gen AI to change the customer experiences and businesses. <strong><strong>We see considerable momentum on the AI front where we've accumulated a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already.</strong></strong><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/5/5/saupload_GMlBgtsaMAApBAx.png\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/5/5/saupload_GMlBgtsaMAApBAx_thumb1.png\" alt=\"Image\"></a></p> </blockquote> <p>Because of the booming demand for AI computing power, Amazon will increase capital expenditures in AWS over the next few quarters. This means that investors should be prepared for some volatility in free cash flow, but the opportunity is well worth it.</p> <p>Notably, the operating margin at AWS reached 37.5% of revenue last quarter, so the company can afford to spend a few extra bucks building capacity for AI opportunities. </p> <h2>Valuation And Timing</h2> <p>Amazon stock is currently trading at around 22 times its operating cash flow, which is cheap by the company's historical standards. We rate Amazon as Start Buying Bellow $225, which provides a 25% upside versus a current stock price below $190. </p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/5/1/saupload_c19f7a1137db3b84ffd9aaff5e093557.png\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon stock is holding well during the recent market correction, and the price action is still favorable as long as the stock holds above $160 per share.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure\" contenteditable=\"false\"><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/5/5/706785-17149209597443469_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1078\" data-height=\"617\"></a><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/5/5/706785-17149209597443469_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1078\" data-height=\"617\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/5/5/706785-17149209597443469.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"366\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"366\" alt=\"\"></a><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"></p></figcaption></figure> ",
